Simple website idea.

At first the idea was a website for people to send nice anonymous messages to strangers, like an online billboard. "Yo, next person, have a great day!". Something like that. Which isn't very original.

But then I thought that since this is the internet, people might be really nasty to each other. So, you visit the website and it says "Welcome to SaySomethingNice.com. Here's a message from a stranger: Go F*%@ yourself!". And honestly, I kind of think that's hilarious. Like giving your friend the middle finger.

So I built it lol. This version uses bootstrap, node, and express. Nothing fancy. I wanted to store the messages on my app server in memory, but I had to add MongoDB for message persistence (because my free heroku deployment powers down / restarts to save power when inactive).

deployed on heroku if your bored or curious - https://saysomethingnicedotcom.herokuapp.com/
