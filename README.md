Simple website to send nice messages to strangers using bootstrap, node, and express.

I haven't decided whether to filter out negative messages and scold users for inputting them, or expect negative messages and sarcastically thank users for sending them.
not sure what's funnier...

Also, obviously don't put this into production! Right now I don't think this has any input validation (not sure if that's part of express body-parser or not), so yeah, if you want to use it live you should add that first. Since it's a personal project it's fine like this for me.
